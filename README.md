# youtube-realtime-translator-v1
A Chrome extension designed to provide real-time translation and voice-over (dubbing), built to address my own workflow needs.


Before loading these files as a Chrome extension via "Load unpacked" in Chrome, you need to install the required libraries.

After that, enable the extension and open your YouTube video. Click the Transcript button below the video, copy the entire transcript along with the timestamps, and translate it into your desired language.

Then paste the translated text into the extension and click Prepare. The extension will automatically merge certain timestamps and optimize them for better synchronization.

Finally, click Start to generate a synchronized dubbing.

Make sure to select your local voice synthesizer according to your preferred language.
